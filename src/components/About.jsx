    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      Hey, I'm Alain — a software engineer focused on process automation. I like building practical, reliable systems.
    </p>
    <p>
      I’ve worked with both frontend and backend technologies, and I enjoy figuring out how everything connects. Most of my experience is in enterprise environments, where I’ve helped streamline workflows and improve software usability.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I’m not working, I’m usually playing guitar, out fishing, or just relaxing.
